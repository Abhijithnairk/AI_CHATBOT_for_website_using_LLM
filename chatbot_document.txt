Frequently Asked Questions

What Is PTE?
The Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE) is a language test designed to assess the use of the English language skills of non-native English speakers. Generally speaking, the PTE test is used to test the skills of non-native speakers intending to apply for university courses in Australia and other English-speaking countries. It’s a computer-based test that offers fast and objective results.

Why is a computer-based test better?
With a computer-based test, your PTE scores can be marked rapidly and sent through quickly. Most test-takers receive their results within 48 hours. It’s also a less stressful format as you don’t have to speak directly to an examiner or write out your answers by hand. Using an automated scoring system that takes human error out of the equation, you can have confidence that the system will judge your English language skills fairly.

How are PTE exams formatted?
PTE exams are 100% computer-based. The test is three hours long and is divided into three sections:

Part 1 – Speaking and Writing (77-93 minutes)
Part 2 – Reading (32-41 minutes)
Part 3 – Listening (45 – 57 minutes)
Throughout the test, you’ll be asked 20 different types of questions, from simple multiple-choice questions to more in-depth essay questions and interpreting information.

Is PTE training widely recognised?
More than 3,000 colleges, institutions, universities, and professional bodies trust PTE to verify applicants’ English skills, including a major Australian education group of universities. The Australian, New Zealand, and UK Governments accept PTE as proof of English proficiency for all visa and migration applications.

As such, there are more than a few PTE institutions across Australia that offer online classes and live sessions for coaching based on the latest PTE prediction file. In order to successfully pass the actual test, it’s important to work with PTE experts that genuinely care about your desired PTE scores. The best PTE online coaching or live classes will prepare you for all the tasks that you will come across within the test; helping you to feel confident on the day of the actual test where you’ll need to choose multiple answers, formulate sentence structure, provide written text, and read aloud. That’s where Englishfirm comes in.

PTE practice and preparation is the key to success – by working with Englishfirm, your chances of successfully passing and learning the English language are greatly increased.

How Does PTE Training Work?
Englishfirm offers flexible PTE class options to fit in with your schedule. We have online and in-person PTE coaching options available and courses that range from two weeks to unlimited classes for those wanting support until they’ve achieved their target score.

Our coaching sessions are designed to simplify passing the PTE test. We make sure that each student is fully aware of the exam format, the technical requirements of the test, and has unlimited access to relevant material. We provide an accelerated learning experience to erase all your doubts and pass the test with flying colours on the first attempt. If a student misses any coursework, we will make sure that they are provided with as much practice material and information as required to get back on track. Live and online coaching is designed to help students achieve their desired PTE score. Our PTE tutorials will provide all exam preparation and mock tests needed to go into the final exam, fully confident in your ability to speak, listen, read, and write with a high level of English language proficiency.

Can You Help Me to Pass My Exam on the First Try?
Yes, we can! We prioritise our PTE students and offer flexible coaching modalities and unlimited practice sessions to ensure you’re successful the first time around. On average, PTE students need ten hours of classes and ten hours of practice to pass the PTE exam, and we’ve found that one-on-one PTE training to be the most effective option to get the results needed for a fantastic PTE score.

How Quickly Can I Start a PTE course?
Englishfirm has two branches in Sydney, conveniently located in the CBD and Parramatta and another in central Melbourne. We operate seven days a week and offer classes year-round. We also offer online options for those not located in Sydney or Melbourne or if you require more flexibility.

What Types of PTE Classes Do Englishfirm Offer?
We offer a range of PTE coaching options, both on and offline, including:

Two-week crash courses for students who have limited time or need to take a test imminently.
Four-week courses covering techniques for all four modules as well as unlimited practice sessions and mock tests.
Unlimited courses that run indefinitely until the student achieves their target score.
How does PTE compare with IELTS?
According to the feedback we’ve received from our test participants, PTE feels less stressful, easier to prepare for, and most importantly, test results come through faster. Most test-takers receive their results within 48 hours. PTE is comparable to IELTS, so if you know which band score you need to apply to study, work, or apply for a visa, you can quickly work out what PTE score you need to achieve with our PTE preparation.

Is a PTE Coach Worth Paying For?
We definitely think it is! Formal training at a PTE centre is not a pre-requisite for taking the PTE exam. In our experience, even if you’re confident in your English language skills, taking the test without adequate preparation can be costly. At $375 per test, costs can quickly mount if you try, and fail, to pass multiple times. Investing a little in tutoring and PTE coaching may well be the wisest option to save you time and money in the long run. You can book a free demo class with Englishfirm to get started.

Whether you’re looking for high PTE academic scores, practice tests, a free demo class or PTE online training, we’re here to help. We can get you where you need to be, with your desired PTE scores on the test. We have the PTE prediction files, practice tests, materials (sectional mock tests included), success stories, and interactive classes to get you the results you need.

Getting a good PTE score means more than cheat sheets and guessing questions on multiple answers. With free access to our mock tests, practice tests, and materials, we’ll help you to improve your speaking skills and writing skills on top of our engaging and interactive classes, to give you so much more than exam preparation. Not only will we help you to achieve a high PTE academic score, but we’ll provide you with a high level of oral fluency in the English language.

At Englishfirm, we take our role in PTE preparation seriously. We understand the importance of passing this test – we’ve been there. For every PTE expert staff member, the success of our students is our number



What Exactly Is PTE?
PTE stands for Pearson Test of English Academic and is a language test designed to assess the English language skills of non-native speakers. This test can be used to apply for university courses and various visas in Australia and other English-speaking countries. It’s a computer-based test that returns results within two days.

Why is a Computer-Based Test Better?
The computer system uses an algorithm to mark your test, therefore you can be assured of fast and accurate assessment. Test results are usually received within 48 hours, which is a big advantage if you need results speedily. Our feedback is that this format is less stressful than a normal exam as you don’t have to speak to an examiner or write out your answers by hand.

How Many Sections In a PTE Exam?
PTE exams are 100% computer-based. Throughout the test, you’ll be asked 20 different types of questions, from simple multiple-choice questions to more in-depth essay and comprehension questions. The test is three hours long and is divided into three sections:

Part 1 – Speaking and Writing (77-93 minutes)

Part 2 – Reading (32-41 minutes)

Part 3 – Listening (45 – 57 minutes) 

Is PTE Training Widely Recognised?
Yes it is! More than 3 000 colleges, institutions, universities, and professional bodies use PTE to assess applicants’ English fluency. The UK, New Zealand, and Australian Governments all accept PTE as proof of English proficiency for visa and migration applications.

Unlimited courses that run indefinitely until the student achieves their target result.
How Quickly Can I Start a PTE Online course?

How Does PTE Compare with IELTS?
Our students think PTE is far less stressful, easier to prepare for, and results are released quicker with most participants receiving results within 48 hours. If in the future, you need to convert your PTE results into IELTS scores this is easily done.



What’s the Difference Between IELTS and PTE Coaching?
Although PTE and IELTS are both English competency tests, they are fundamentally different. PTE Academic is a fully computerised exam, meaning that the test is taken on a computer and the marking is done by a computer too. Even the speaking part of the exam is stored, interpreted, and scored by the computer using an inbuilt algorithm. Therefore preparation for PTE Academic is quite different to an IELTS exam, which a human assessor usually marks. Preparation for PTE can be tailored to the PTE scoring guide, meaning that it’s relatively easy to prepare well. 

PTE scores are available quickly, usually in less than five business days which is a huge advantage for candidates who need to submit their scores by a specific date for admission to a course or an urgent visa application. Paper-based IELTS exam results can take up to 13 days to receive. PTE scores are also easily transferable. Therefore if you do well in one section but fail another, you can re-take your weaker sections to help increase your overall marks. Here at Englishfirm, we offer both PTE Academic, Naati CCL and IELTS coaching.

PTE is often undertaken for Australian Visa and study opportunities. PTE is used by the Australian Border Control for permanent residency Visa applications

How to Choose the Best PTE Classes in Parramatta?
A simple web search for “PTE classes Parramatta” will yield hundreds of results, so how do you choose the best PTE classes for you? At Englishfirm, we think it’s important you’re comfortable with your trainers, the PTE training institute, and the course structure before you commit.

We offer free demonstrations so that all our prospective students know exactly what to expect when the course starts. Students can also get a sense of our teaching style and whether they’re comfortable with our methods. We also think it’s essential to ensure that all our students have full access to practice materials, mock tests, and teacher feedback to ensure they’re successful the first time around.

How Much Should I Spend on PTE Coaching?
We’ve seen all too many test-takers attempt PTE Academic without adequate exam preparation and come away unsuccessful. Although it might seem expensive to invest in coaching initially, spending money on repeat attempts at PTE is unnecessary and wasteful.  

Instead, you could spend between $500-$700 on basic PTE coaching classes and go into the test with confidence and a strategy for a good PTE score. Achieving the results you require the first time around saves both money and time, making PTE coaching in Parramatta a wise investment.

How Many Classes Do I Have to Attend?
On average, we’ve found that students need around 10 hours of coaching and 10 hours of practice to complete PTE and get their desired score. However, this isn’t set in stone and required exam preparation can vary from student to student. It’s important to note that one hour with a private trainer is vastly different to one hour in a class setting. Private sessions are, by their nature, fully customisable and the perfect forum for a student to ask questions and have their concerns cleared up.  

PTE practice is the key to success and achieving your desired results. A high overall score is often achieved by those who put the most into their PTE practice and are fully committed to improving their English language proficiency. If you want to achieve your desired score – through training in Parramatta or online coaching –  it’s time to turn to the best PTE coaching with Englishfirm.

Are Online PTE Classes Worth It? 
If you’re not able to attend PTE classes in Parramatta in person, online classes are a fantastic option to get a high PTE score and improve your English language proficiency. Both online and face-to-face PTE courses are one-on-one and structured exactly the same way so students can be confident they’re getting the same information and instruction. Another advantage of online classes is that they’re super flexible and can be scheduled according to student availability.

Parramatta is a thriving metropolis attracting people from all over the world, as such there’s always a huge demand for PTE classes in and around the area. For some people, directly communicating with their instructor in person may be the best way to learn. Immigrants typically have to take PTE to prove their English competency for work, education, or residency, so there may be advantages of attending classes face-to-face to make assimilation easier. PTE training in Parramatta means that you have access to leading English Academic coaches, online coaching, and PTE experts who are here to help you every step of the way.

Resources for Best PTE Coaching Parramatta
There are many free and paid resources available online purporting to help you study for PTE, but it can be a challenge to determine which practice tests are worth investing in and which resources aren’t. To ensure our quality of teaching remains high, all our students (both online and in-person) have access to a wide range of resources and mock tests. This includes practice materials and questions, tutorial videos, mock tests, podcasts and a special PTE Academic study group. Every student also has access to a revision class, mock tests, and pre-exam consultation. You’ll be as prepared as possible, and with our track record of high PTE score after score, we’re confident you’ll be 100% satisfied with the training you receive.

What is PTE Academic?
The Pearson Test of English (PTE) is an English test that is designed for non-native English speakers. The test is dedicated to assessing and validating the use of the English language and ensuring that students speaking English as a second language has the requisite English level skills required to apply for university courses in English speaking countries – like in Australia.

How do I sit a PTE test?
PTE academic tests are completed online through a computer-based program for testing. The test will examine proficiency in reading and listening to English over a course of three hours. Students will be required to submit voice notes as part of the exam which will be sent off for examination and grading purposes.

A key advantage of PTE testing is fast turnaround and results for students. Unlike some testing which can take weeks or months to hear back from, the online element of the exam ensures fast results for test takers.

Who accepts PTE results?
PTE academic results are accepted by most universities around the world. The PTE academic score required for admission into tertiary education programs will depend on the institution that you apply with, and the course that you plan to complete. At the time of writing, Australia and New Zealand accept PTE test results for the purposes of immigration into the country.

Who is eligible to sit the PTE Academic test?
Students that are looking to move abroad to further their tertiary studies or migrate to Australia or New Zealand may sit the test. Test takers that complete the test should be at least 16-years of age, however, students that are under the age of 18 will require a note from their parent or guardian at the time of the test. Your Sydney PTE coach will run you through all of the prerequisites and clearly explain the process and eligibility requirements to sit the PTE test in Sydney, Australia.

Do you provide mock PTE tests?
Yes! Mock tests or practice PTE tests are an essential element in preparing test takers for their examination. Tutors will provide you with immediate feedback and advice based on the outcome of the results and recommend whether or not a student is ready to sit their exam ahead of time.

Why should I get PTE coaching Sydney?  
PTE is a complex and stressful test. You must prove your abilities in reading, writing, listening, and speaking English with a 2–3-hour period. You might think you can take the test without having training first, but training will give you an understanding of the structure of the test and will give you access to advanced strategies you can rely on when you’re nervous. When you consider each failed attempt will cost you around $375, attempting the test without some basic training is clearly a false economy.

PTE exam preparation is the key to acing the computer based test and living the Australian dream. With the PTE experts at Englishfirm, you can get exam preparation that will improve oral fluency, reading and written discourse, and listening – enabling skills that will genuinely benefit you in the real world in Australia. Depending on the test date of your computer based test for PTE,  we can help you to get your desired score through our flexible timetable of classes. Whether you’re looking to study in Australia or you’re applying for a Visa, we help a wide range of students from other countries save time and money by giving them the best chance possible of achieving a high PTE score.

How much should I spend on Sydney PTE coaching?
As a test taker, you should spend as much as you can to make sure you feel confident and calm when you take the test. We’ve seen too many people take the Sydney PTE test without adequate training and fail. Although it might seem expensive at the beginning, spending money on repeated attempts at PTE is unnecessary and a waste of both your time and money.

Instead of repeated attempts, you could spend between $500-$700 on basic PTE coaching and go into the test with confidence and a strategy for success. Achieving the results you require the first time around saves your valuable resources.

How to choose the best PTE school in Sydney?

We also think it’s essential to ensure that all our students have full access to practice materials, mock tests, and teacher feedback to ensure they’re successful the first time around.

How many Classes do I have to attend?
The simple answer is – it depends! Everyone is different, so what works for one person might not be right for another. In general, we’ve found that most students need about ten hours of coaching and ten hours of practice to successfully complete PTE Academic. Having said that, there’s a vast difference between an hour spent in personal training and one spent in a class setting. Private sessions are, by their very nature, fully tailored to you and your particular needs.

Can I attend PTE classes online?
If your schedule doesn’t allow you to attend in-person classes, online sessions are a great alternative. Online classes are conducted on Zoom and follow the same structure as any other face-to-face class.

Why Should I Get PTE Coaching?  
You should consider PTE coaching as the basic truth is that all exams are stressful. Add to the mix the fact you have to complete this one in a language that isn’t your native tongue, and you have a recipe for high pressure.

PTE is a complex test made up of four modules designed to test all aspects of your English language abilities. The reading, writing, listening, and speaking components all need to be completed in a 2–3-hour period with no exceptions. You might think you can take the test without some training first, but when you consider each failed attempt will cost you around $375, attempting the test without some basic training is clearly a false economy.

How Much Should I Spend on PTE Coaching?

At Englishfirm, we’ve seen lots of Melbourne students take the test without adequate training. Although PTE coaching might seem expensive initially, the disappointment of failing is much worse.

Everyone is unique and what works for one person won’t necessarily be right for another. Private tutoring will help your trainer understand how you learn best and tailor the classes to your particular needs. It goes without saying that one hour spent in a private session is vastly different to an hour spent in a group class.

IELTS Preparation Course: What’s Involved in the Test?
Listening  
The listening paper contains 40 questions and approximately 30 minutes is allotted to complete this section. There are four parts, with 10 questions in each part. Parts one and two deal with everyday interactions and social situations. In parts three and four educational and training situations are covered. In the recordings for each section different accents including British, American, Australian and New Zealand are used.

Reading
The reading paper contains 40 questions in three sections and lasts an hour. Texts for the reading section of the paper come from various sources including newspapers, books, magazines, journals, and websites. The topics covered are general interest topics that may be written in different styles and could contain diagrams, graphs, or illustrations. There will be at least one text that contains a detailed and logical argument.

Writing 
In the writing section, there are two different tasks to be completed within an hour. For task one, you must describe some visual information (a graph, table, chart or diagram) in your own words. You must write at least 150 words in 20 minutes. For task two you will be given a point of view or argument that you need to discuss. You need to write 250 words in about 40 minutes. Answers are to be written in full sentences, with no bullet points or notes.

Speaking
The speaking test takes the form of a face-to-face interview between the candidate and an examiner. The test will take between 11 – 14 minutes. The speaking test is recorded in three parts. Speaking tests are marked according to four criteria; fluency and coherence, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy and pronunciation.

What Is the Format of the CCL Test?
CCL exams are taken online and are made up of two different passages of dialogue between a native English speaker and a LOTE speaker. Each dialogue is approximately 300 words, with about 50 per cent of the dialogue in English and the rest in the test language. Each section of dialogue is further divided into segments of not more than 35 words. A chime will indicate when each short segment ends. The tester will pause the recording at each chime and allow the candidate to complete the response. The tester will then restart the recording and play the next segment only when the candidate has finished their response.

How Long Do I Have to Wait for My Results?
 All CCL tests are conducted by NAATI online. Results are usually released 8-10 weeks after the test is completed.

How Is the CCL Test Marked?
Each passage of dialogue is marked out of a total of 45 points. In order to pass the test, you need to score a minimum of 29 points for each passage of dialogue, and at least 63 out of 90 overall. You have one repeat opportunity per section of dialogue without any penalty. We recommend you utilise this provision in each section.

You will be penalised for every error in your response. Errors include grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary, hesitations, omission, and additions in speech.

You’re allowed to correct yourself if you make a mistake while speaking. Although points will be deducted for corrections, it’s better to make a correction with some points deducted than answering wrong and receiving no points at all.

What Topics Can Be Covered in The NAATI CCL Test?
The CCL test can cover a range of topics, including:

Health
Legal
Community
Immigration and settlement
Education
Social services
Finance
Housing
Business
Employment
Insurance
Consumer affairs
What Are Your Top Tips for Notetaking in The CCL Test?
You are allowed to take notes while completing your exam. Our advice is to:

Use abbreviations instead of writing in complete sentences
Develop a strategy that works for you
Listen and make notes simultaneously
Focus on listening so that you fully understand the dialogue
Use the visualisation technique to remember the topics discussed
Be careful to record names, dates, location, and address accurately
What Will the Best CCL Course Sydney Cover During Preparation?
A course that encourages you to implement theoretical knowledge into practice is the best preparation for CCL you can get. It’s crucial to practice speaking slowly and clearly before your exam, in both English and the test language. You should practice both languages as much as possible before sitting your exam. Remember to maintain a regular fluency that isn’t too fast or too slow and take your time when you answer; a 2-5 second pause is acceptable. Using a varied vocabulary is also important. Expand your vocabulary as much as possible by reviewing your Shabd Kosh Dictionary.

Why Should I Book English Coaching Sydney?  
Moving to a new country and adjusting to a new culture and language is one of the most stressful things a person can do in life. And while a new life in Sydney offers many advantages, it’s hard to make full use of the benefits offered to you if you’re unable to understand the world around you or communicate effectively. Personalised English lessons will help you transition as seamlessly as possible into a new life and enjoy life in Australia to the full. 

How Much Should I Spend on an English Course Sydney?
Any training is an investment – we believe you should spend as much as you can to help you feel confident when conversing in English. If you’re studying English with a specific goal in mind, it’s impossible to make as much progress with self-study as you can with an experienced and knowledgeable tutor by your side. The most efficient way to improve quickly is to access one-on-one tutoring.  

How to Choose the Best English School in Sydney?
The best school for you will be a place where you feel comfortable and can make meaningful connections with your teacher and fellow students. Other important facts to consider are the location of your classes as we’ve found that students lose motivation quickly if they have to travel long distances. For this reason, we offer online classes Sydney-wide for students seeking convenient and tailored sessions. 

Choosing an accredited English school is important because you want to complete classes with concrete improvements in key skills and the ability to speak, listen, write, and read in English confidently. Sessions can be tailored to your schedule, but they should not be so short that you don’t get a chance to take in information or ask questions. Nor should sessions be so long that you become tired and lose concentration. We usually recommend sessions of up to an hour, on at least a weekly basis.
